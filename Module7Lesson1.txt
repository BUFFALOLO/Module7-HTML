LESSON 1 - HTML BASICS & DOCUMENT structure

HTML: HyperText Markup language

Tags: Tags tell the browser how to show the content. (<p> </p>)
Elements: Complete instructions in the script. (the content in between the tags)
Attributes: Provide additional information about elements which reside in the opening tag. (<img src="stage.jpg" alt-"Theater stage" - src & alt are attributes)

Not all tags require a closing tag, for example img or <br> for breaks

<!DOCTYPE html> is positioned at the top of your HTML document, it signifies the type of document to be showcased. It's similar to telling the browser, "Get ready, an HTML5 performance is starting!".
This ensures the browser interprets the page as an HTML5 document.

After the DOCTYPE declaration, you encounter the <html> tag. Think of this tag as swinging open the majestic doors of a theater - it signifies the start & conclusion of your HTML document.
It wraps around everything in your webpage, from the metadata in the head to the content in the body.

Inside the <html> tag, we have the <head> section. It gives important info about the document, not the actual content. In the <head>, there's metadata, such as <title>, which is the name of the document.
This name appears in the browser's title bar or tab. The head can also hae links to stylesheets, and scripts.

The core of your HTML document is the <body> section, where all the content resides. Everything that the website users, interacts with, text, images, videos, links, buttons, etc., is placed here. 
The body is where your website springs to life.

UNDERSTANDING & USING META TAGS
In web development, think of meta tags in HTML like the playbill you get before a show. They provide important details about the performance but are not visible to the audience (website users).
Instead, they act as guides for search engines & browsers to understand & display the content effectively.

Let's enhance our "Hello World" HTML page by adding some meta tags to the <head> section. These won't alter what's visible on the website's body but they'll improve the page's behind-the-scenes details.
Meta tags in the <head> section offer essential information to browsers and search engines:

    Charset: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring correct character display.
    Viewport: Crucial for responsive design, ensuring proper display on all devices.
    Description: A concise summary of the page's content, crucial for SEO.
    Keywords: Helps search engines understand the main topics of your page.
    Author: Credits the creator of the HTML document.

BASIC HTML ELEMENTS
Fundamental HTML elements play a role similar to props, characters, & script notes in a theatrical production, infusing life into the play on stage. They add structure, emphasis & detail to our digital theater,
enhancing the performance (web content) to be more engaging & accessible. 

In HTML, headings serve as scene titles in a play, delineating various sections & topics. Spanning from <h1> as the main title to <h6> as the least significant, they establish a hierarchy of importance.
Paragraphs, identified by <p>, function as the dialogues or monologues in our script. They make up the majority of the content, delivering the message to the audience (the users).

Formatting tags like <b> (bold), <strong> (important bold), <i> (italic), and <em> (emphasized italic) act as stage directions, guiding actors on how to deliver their lines. These tags
contribute emphasis & tone to our web content.

HTML lists resemble well-organized bullet points or numbered steps in a script. Unordered lists (<ul>) employ bullet points, comparable to listing props or actors. In contrast, ordered lists (<ol>)
use numbers, resembling a step-by-step guide for scene changes. Each item in the list is denotes by a <li> (list item) tag.

Hyperlinks, created with an <a>, are like stage doorways guiding the audience to different scenes. Images, marked with <img>, add visuals to the stage, enhancing storytelling.
    href attribute: Used in <a>, href is like creating a portal to other scenes or places.
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit our site</a>

    src attribute: In <img>, src sets the background scenery, specifying where to find the image.
    <img src="stage.jpg">

    alt attribute: alt in <img> is an image understudy. If the image can't be shown, alt provide alternative text, ensuring the message is still conveyed.
    <img src="stage.jpg" alt="Theater stage">

The <br> tag is similar to a pause in an actor's speech, initiating a new line without commencing a new paragraph.
On the other hand, the <hr> tag, symbolizing a horizontal rule, acts as a scene divider, introducing a visual break in the content.

Special characters, such as &amp for the ampersand symbol, serve as HTML's special effects, introducing distinctive elements to the text. 
HTML comments, structured as <!-- Comment -->, act as backstage notes, hidden from the audience but valuable for developers.

BEST PRACTICES & COMMON PITFALLS IN BASIC HTML development
Following these guidelines & learning from cautionary tales can assist both novice & seasoned developers in ensuring that their HTML script not only establishes the stage effectively but also captivates the audience (the users) seamlessly.

1. Proper Document Structure: Begin with <!DOCTYPE html> & structure with <html>, <head>, & <body> tags.
2. Semantic HTML: Use tags for their intended purposes (e.g., <p> for paragraphs, <h1> to <h6> headings, <a> for links).
3. Alt Text for Images: Always add alt attributes in <img> tags. It aids accessibility & SEO.
4. Descriptive Titles & Meta Descriptions: Employ meaningful titles in <title>, & clear meta descriptions for user understanding.
5. Responsive Design: Implement responsive techniques, including the viewport meta tag, for a user-friendly experience across devices.

1. Neglecting Meta Tags: Skipping or misconfiguring meta tags (e.g., charset, viewport, description & keywords) can harm your page's functionality & SEO, leaving users & search engines in the dark.
2. Improper Heading Use: Misusing heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) disrupts webpage structure & accessibility. Overusing <h1> tags or disregarding logical order is confusing.
3. Omitting Closing Tags: Forgetting to close tags, especially in non-self-closing elements, results in unexpected layout & styling issues. 
4. Incorrect Link Usage: Misusing the <a> tag, linking to broken URLs or incorrect href attributes, leads to a poor user experience.
5. Media Not Optimized: Using large, unoptimized images or media files slows down your website, negatively impacting user experience.
