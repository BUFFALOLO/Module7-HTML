ADVANCED TEXT HTML ELEMENTS - HTML ELEMENTS FOR CONTENT & LAYOUT

<table> - creates the shelf
<th> used for headers like category labels
<tr> - defines the rows 
<tdr> represents the individual cells

Tables are versatile tools in web development offering a structured way to present various data, from financial reports to gaming leaderboards.
They provide clarity & organization, making information readily accessible & comprehensible. 

<blockquote> - used for longer quotes
<q> - used for shorter, inline quotations

Quotations are the memorable dialogues of your content, offering authority, perspective, or wisdom. They leave a lasting impression, akin to memorable lines from a movie.
For example, incorporating testimonials from colleagues or supervisors can personalize your resume.

<code> - used for inline code ELEMENTS
<pre> - preserves formatting, which is ideal for larger code blocks

For any tech-related site, code snippets are essential. They're like the step-by-step instructions in a DIY manual, helping users understand & follow along. 
If your work involves coding, displaying snippets can effectively showcase your expertise.

MULTIMEDIA ELEMENTS
By integrating multimedia components, you're not only narrating your tale but presenting it vividly with vibrant visuals & immersive sound. Let's emphasize the inclusion of images, audio & video,
including techniques for seamlessly integrating YouTube videos, to enhance the appeal of your online presence to its fullest potential.

<img> - allows you to embed images that reflect your professional persona, projects, or achievements.
HTML - allows you to add images
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets enables you to integrate images into your resume's design, adjusting their size, alignment, & responsiveness to different screen sizes.

SEMANTIC HTML5
Semantic elements are essential as they clarify the intent of the content they enclose, simplifying comprehension for both web browsers & human users.
Additionally, they:
    Aid in search engines indexing the page content.
    Enhance Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
    Facilitate interpretation by screen readers.
    Improve accessibility for visually impaired users.

Common Semantic Elements 
    <header> - This tag acts as the introduction to your page or section of it. It often contains the navigation bar, logos & introductory content
    <footer> - Houses contact information, copyright notices, & links to legal information or related documents.
    <article> - This element is used for sel-contained composition in a document, page, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, such as blog posts or news articles.
    <section> - A section groups related content together. It could be chapters, header, footers, or any other sections of the document.
    <nav> - Short for navigation, this element guides the audience through the web page's different scenes or sections.
    <aside> - This tag is used for tangentially related content, similar to a sidebar conversation, that complements the main content, like related links, biographies or advertisements.

OTHER HTML5 ELEMENTS
HTML5 has introduced a variety of elements that allow for more descriptive document structure & clearer code semantics.

<figure> - This element is used to represent self-contained content, often referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document. This could include images, diagrams, code snippets, etc.
Accompanied by the <figcaption> element, it allows for a caption or description to be directly associated with the <figure>.

Example Integration:
Let's add a <figure> element to showcase a project screenshot within the Recent Projects section, with a <figcaption> to describe it.

<section>
    <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
    <figure>
        <img src="website_redesign_screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Website Redesign">
        <figcaption>Fig.1 - Screenshot of the Website Redesign Project.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>

<main> - This element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. It is intended for the content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, 
excluding content repeated across pages like headers & footers.

Example Integration:
Integrating <main> into our resume to encapsulate the core content

<body>
    <header>...</header>
    <main>
        <!-- All sections like skills, education, work experience go here -->
    </main>
    <footer>...</footer>
</body>

BEST PRACTICES
Choose the Right Tag for the Job: Ensure you use the appropriate text elements (<strong>, <em>, <blockquote>, etc.) to convey the right emphasis & structure.
Keep Accessibility in Mind: Use markup that enhances readability & structure, such as headings (<h1> through <h6>) & lists (<ul>,<ol>)
Optimize Media Files: Optimize images, audio & video for web use to ensure fast load times & smooth playback.
Provide Alternatives: Offer captions, transcripts, & alt text for multimedia content, making your site more accessible & inclusive.
Structure Content Logically: Use semantic elements (<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, etc.) to structure your content meaningfully.
Use Landmark Roles: These roles help screen reader users navigate your site more easily.

COMMON PITFALLS
Overuse of Styling Elements for Layout: Using <br> for spacing or <b> for headings instead of CSS and semantic.
Ignoring Hierarchial Structure: Skipping heading levels or using them inconsistently.
Autoplaying Videos or Audio: Autoplay can be intrusive & annoying for web users, especially if they can't easily find the controls.
Using Non-Responsive Media: Failing to make multimedia content responsive can break the layout on mobile devices.
Overlooking Document Outline: Ignoring the new HTML5 structural elements can lead to a confusing & poorly structured document outline.
Misusing Sections & Articles: Using <section> or <article> interchangeably without understanding their purpose.
